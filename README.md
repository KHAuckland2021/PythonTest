# PythonTest

- Find and fix the errors in the web application (main.py)
- Refactor the program to make it more modular (using a Pythonic style, e.g. numpy)
- Implement an additional function geometric_series_sum() which takes an input parameter a and r
  to calculate the sum of the first N elements of: a + a * r + a * r^2 + a * r^3 + ...
- Test the application (what approach would you use for test?)
